This is a work-in-progress blog post.
I will update this blog post if I find new blogs in robotics and related fields.
I hope readers will offer their own favourites in the comments.

This list is in alphanumeric order.



**arg min** by Ben Recht

Ben Recht's blog [arg min: a blog of minimum value](https://www.argmin.net/) deals with the history, foundations, and validity of decision-making.
He also has some [live blog and commentary](https://www.argmin.net/p/lecture-blogs) on his lectures.
You can also find [arg min on Substack](https://substack.com/@beenwrekt).


**Incomplete Ideas** by Richard S. Sutton

Richard S. Sutton wrote down some of his strong opinions on AI and RL.  In [Incomplete Ideas](http://www.incompleteideas.net/), you can find his famous ["The Bitter Lesson."](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html)


**Matt's Robotics Blog** by Matthew T. Mason

[Matthew T. Mason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_T._Mason) started his blog in October 2024.
He explores "the coolest and funnest ideas in robotics".
[Matt's Robotics Blog](https://mtmason.com/matt-mason-robotics-blog/) is a mix of philosophical exploration and topics in manipulation.
After all, he was the founder of the Manipulation Laboratory and, he holds a position as Chief Scientist at Berkshire Grey.
