This is a work-in-progress blog post.
I will update this blog post if I find new blogs in robotics and related fields.
I hope readers will offer their own favourites in the comments.

This list is in alphanumeric order.

**AI Blog** by J端rgen Schmidhuber

This [AI Blog](https://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/blog.html) is the work of [J端rgen Schmidhuber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%BCrgen_Schmidhuber).
Yes, _You\_again Shmidhoobuh_ is trying hard to do the self-correction part in the machine learning community.
The latest blog posts will be part of his upcoming book.
