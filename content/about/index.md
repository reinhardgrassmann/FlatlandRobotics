**About this Blog**

_The stronger you build the foundation, the taller you can build the building._
With that in mind, I will try build this foundation by starting with a simple setting and getting exposed to the core ideas.
Most of my blog posts are tutorials and philosophical explorations by nature.
By writing about robotics on my own blog, I hope to reflect on my understanding, gain mental clarity, and develop original thoughts at some point.
I invite you to join me on this journey, a journey through Flatland Robotics.

**About this Guy**

This part is to talk about myself and show that I'm credible in some sense.
So, here we go.

I hold a Ph.D. in CS with an emphasis in robotics from Toronto, Canada.
For better or worse, robotics is often lumped together with Computer Science or Engineering$-$No robotics department yet.
I also have an M.Sc. and a B.Sc. in Mechatronics from Hannover, Germany.
I've worked with light-weight robots (now called Cobots) and continuum robots.
The whole shebang: from designing, prototyping, algorithmic foundation, modeling, planning, and controlling, to unindented destruction of my robotic prototypes.
This also includes learning-based approaches.

As a teaching assistant, I taught and mentored the basis of robotics for undergrads and some advanced topics for grad students. 
Mathematics for freshmen played a big role early on, too.
Furthermore, I supervised and mentored several students, including volunteers, research opportunity students, summer students, and thesis candidates.
